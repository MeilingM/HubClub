  <p>You've stumbled upon a top secret lab! Maybe you can cook something up to get yourself out of this mess. Too bad that most the supplies you need
    are locked away in drawers! Each drawer can only be unlocked by another element. Solve the following riddles to figure out
    which set of elements will unlock the drawers! By the way, get a periodic table!</p>
