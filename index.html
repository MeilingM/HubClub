<h1>Locked</h1>
<p>You've been sucked into cyberspace! More specifically, you're trapped in this website, HubClubHunt. I don't really have a good 
  explanation for <i>how</i> one would get trapped inside a <i><a href="lobby.html">webpage</a></i>, but just roll with it, okay?</p>
<p>Anyways, you have an hour from now to find a way out. You must find your way to the End Screen. It's purple, and totally
fab (because all the pages I design are purple and fab).</p>
<p>Your first clue is this:</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>P.S. For all you trekkies out there, let's just say that a transporter malfunction beamed you into a
random webpage. And if you've never watched Star Trek, then I don't have a good explanation. Also you should watch it.</p>
