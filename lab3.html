<p>Well, you didn't find any elements in the thrid drawer but there was a key. There are also a few locked doors. You must pick the correct one.</p>
<p>BEWARE, you have reached a checkpoint. If you choose the wrong door, GAME OVER</p>
<p>Here are your clues:<p>
<p>The first door may be your answer</p>
<p>The last one may also be your answer</p>
<p>But if the Green door is not your answer, then the last door may not be your answer either</p>
<p>The Blue door is correct if the Yellow door is correct</p>
<p>Green most likely isn't correct if Blue is your answer</p>
<p>Unless the Yellow door is right, Green is surely wrong.</p>
<p>One thing you know for sure: Blue is your doom</p>
